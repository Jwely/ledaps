  * lndsr
    # Modified the QA bands in lndsr to not have a fill_value written in the XML file.  The fill information is available from the fill band itself.

  * ledapsAncSrc
    # Added a check to the updatencep application to make sure the input NCEP variables are floating point and not int16, to better support the latest changes of NCEP products and to catch if we are still trying to process the old-style NCEP products.
