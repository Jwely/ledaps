====Updates on March 20, 2013 - USGS EROS====
  * lndpm
    # Modified to utilize a single Version value version supporting two version tags with the same value.  Migrating to LEDAPSVersion.
    # Modified LPGS and NLAPS WO sections to read the scene center time from the MTL or WO file and pass that time along as the ACQUISITION_TIME in the .metadata.txt file.  This means that the lndsr and lndsrbm applications will have the actual scene time for processing versus approximating the scene time.  The scene time is used to obtain the appropriate atmospheric correction information from the various auxiliary files.
    # Modified to support the processing of polar stereographic products (polar regions) for LPGS and NLAPS WO products.

  * lndsr
    # Modified the data fields in the output metadata to be one-based so they align with the metadata fields appended in lndapp.
    # Modified the fill_QA band to flag pixels as fill if the pixel is fill in any of the reflective bands and not just band 1 as was the previous implementation.
    # Added META_FILE field to the lndsr parameter file.  This field is read and used for the output lndsr metadata.
    # Added a global metadata tag called LPGSMetadataFile to keep track of the input LPGS metadata file used for processing the L1G/L1T product.  This file contains information that will be of value to the downstream user.
    # Modified the 6s processing to utilize descriptive filenames for the 6s command and 6s output files.  These files are no longer deleted but instead are left for the user to review/utilize, if desired.  These files are written to the local directory instead of /tmp.

  * lndapp
    # Added band6_fill_QA as an additional quality band to be output in the surface reflectance product. 

  * bin
    # Modified do_ledaps.py to allow the user to call this script from any directory vs. the directory where the MTL file resides.  The script will parse the directory from the MTL file and then change to that directory to process the data.

  * ledapsAncSrc
    # Modified the update scripts to limit the number of retries to 5 in the case the ftp site is not available or due to a connection problem.
