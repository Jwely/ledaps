Revision:

revision 1.2.0  3/28/2013  Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- modified to utilize a single Version value version supporting two version
  tags with the same value.  migrating to LEDAPSVersion.
- modified LPGS section to read the scene center time from the MTL file and
  pass that time along as the ACQUISITION_TIME in the .metadata.txt file.
  This means that the lndsr and lndsrbm applications will have the actual
  scene time for processing versus approximating the scene time.  The scene
  time is used to obtain the appropriate atmospheric correction information
  from the various auxiliary files.
- modified all read routines to use the #defines for the output header
  file fields to keep the header file fields consistent for each of the
  possible various input sources and to provide for easier maintenance.
- modified to support polar stereographic projection for LPGS and NLAPS WO
  products.

revision 1.1.1  11/30/2012  Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- changed spelling of SATTELITE to SATELLITE

revision 1.1.0  11/13/2012  Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- modified to DIE vs. WARN if the ancillary products (REANALYSIS, EP/TOMS, or
  DEM) do not exist.
- modified the metadata filename to be *.metadata.txt vs. *.carbon_met.txt.

revision 1.0.0  10/26/2012  Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- modified the application to utilize the GCTP library delivered with the
  HDF-EOS library, since that version of the GCTP library is now needed to
  link code with HDF-EOS

revision 1.0.0  09/18/2012 Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- lndcsm will no longer be called and used as input to lndsr

revision 1.0.0  09/11/2012 Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- updated lndpm based on mods provided by Feng Gao from 1/18/2012
  -- restores the solar zenith angle bug fix from the past for NLAP_W0 format
     (Greg Ederer)
  -- fixes a bug when writing the UTM zone (south) into the ENVI hdr file
     (Greg Ederer)
  -- added processing for Landsat-4 TM (Feng Gao)

revision 1.0.0  08/17/2012 Gail Schmidt, USGS EROS
- updated the metadata tags to work with the newly released LPGS metadata
  as well as continuing to support the old metadata tags
- cleaned up warning messages from compilation
- reset the version to 1.0.0 as this is our first official version of
  LEDAPS for the ESPA system
- changed the DataProvider to USGS/EROS

revision 1.5.7  10/22/2010 Feng Gao
- included global DEM file for lndsr processing
- used actual LMIN, LMAX, QCALMIN and QCALMAX values for ETM+ calibration if provided in LPGS metadata, otherwise still use gain_settings (HIGH or LOW)
- cleaned compiling warning messages

revision 1.5.6  9/29/2009 Greg Ederer
- replaced hard coded version strings with macros that can be overridden at compile time. 
  The build script can substitute current version info automatically.

revision 1.5.5  9/28/2009 Greg Ederer and Feng Gao 
- replaced fixed ancillary data path with path searched from ANC_PATH 

revision 1.5.4  6/22/2009 Feng Gao
- fixed a bug in computing bais from (lmin, lmax) and (qmin, qmax)  

revision 1.5.3  4/7/2009 Feng Gao
- read GTRasterTypeGeoKey from GeoTiff file and determine the coordinate for the UL of the UL pixel
  (note that both LPGS and NLAPS use CENTER of pixel in the provided text metadata)
  However, in GeoTiff file, LPGS  uses center (RasterPixelIsArea) 
                            NLAPS uses upper left (RasterPixelIsPoint)

revision 1.5.2  4/2/2009 Feng Gao
- added option on re-calibration for public version
  in "lndcal*.txt" added:   RE_CAL = "NO" or RE_CAL = "FALSE"
  (default: do re-calibration as internal ledaps does)
- included ENVI header for each HDF file so ENVI can load correct geo-reference information

revision 1.5.1 3/19/2009 Feng Gao
- corrected LMIN, LMAX conversion to gain and bias using actual QCALMIN and QCALMAX in the meta file 
- used actual gain and bias values for TM to match recent changes in "lndcal"

revision 1.5  12/16/2008 Feng Gao
- added processing for LPGS TM data (newly EROS released TM and ETM+)    

revision 1.4  8/28/2007  Feng Gao
- added processing for MSS data

revision 1.3  6/22/2007  Feng Gao
- now accept LC-ComPS "standard" metadata from UMD (file name must in *.umd)

revision 1.2  10/21/2006 Feng Gao
- read upper left coordinate from image file if it is a GeoTiff input
  note that metadata in GeoCover data are not updated on UL coordinate

revision 1.1  2/24/2006  Feng Gao
- revise to accept metadata from both NLAPS and LPGS Landsat processing system  
- add error handling 
- add log report

original version - 04/05 by Feng Gao
